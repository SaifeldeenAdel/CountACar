  ✔ Allow user to choose boundary rectangle 
  ✔ Allow user to choose line threshold which car should cross
  ✔ Figure out less computational way to update frame 
  ✔ Return boundary and threshold 
  ✔ Display single frame from video instead of playing video 

Car Counter:

  ✔ Only detect within boundary set by user
  ✔ Assign objects unique ids and track them using IOU
